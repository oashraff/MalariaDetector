# Malaria Detector

A machine learning project for detecting and classifying malaria-infected cells from microscopic images.

## 📋 Overview

This project implements a deep learning model to automatically detect malaria parasites in blood cell images. Malaria detection through microscopic examination of blood smears is a time-consuming process that requires expertise. This automated solution aims to assist in faster and more accurate diagnosis.

## 🚀 Features

- Automated malaria parasite detection in cell images
- Deep learning-based image classification
- Jupyter Notebook implementation for easy experimentation and visualization
- Data processing and model training pipeline

```

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oashraff/MalariaDetector.git
cd MalariaDetector
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## 🎯 Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Malaria_Classification.ipynb
```

2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Train the classification model
   - Evaluate model performance
   - Make predictions on new images

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses microscopic blood cell images to classify between:
- **Parasitized cells**: Cells infected with malaria parasites
- **Uninfected cells**: Healthy blood cells

Place your dataset in the `data/` directory before running the notebook.

## 🔬 Methodology

The project typically involves:
1. **Data Loading**: Loading microscopic cell images
2. **Preprocessing**: Image normalization and augmentation
3. **Model Architecture**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification
4. **Training**: Model training with validation
5. **Evaluation**: Performance metrics and visualization
